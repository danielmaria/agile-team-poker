# **Agile Team Poker Online**

Inspired by the [Agile Team Poker](https://dionatanmoura.com/2022/02/16/agile-team-poker-dbc-um-assessment-para-times-ageis/) approach, this app allows an organizer to create a room, invite players, and estimate tasks together. The game features customizable rooms, session management, and the ability to download game reports.
